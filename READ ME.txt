# Laravel Website Project

### 👋 Project by **DrPotato2002** (Ihab Omar Oubrahim)

This Laravel-based website is currently under active development. It features both public-facing user pages and an admin dashboard for content and user management.

## 📌 Overview

This project is built using **Laravel 11**, **PHP (latest version)**, and a **MySQL** database.  
The application includes:

- User authentication (MailTrap integration is in beta)
- A dynamic dashboard with sections for managing: Contacts,Users,Comments etc...

I’m also currently working on editing the CRM features and enhancing the backend interface. The website is not fully completed yet — it’s around **65% done**.
